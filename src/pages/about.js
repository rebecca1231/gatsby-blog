          My first experience with development was when I was 13. I made my own
          web page (with all the bad poetry) and had a lot of fun creating
          styles. I would look at the source code of other sites and dissect how
          they worked. I used that knowledge to make a hover effect with a
          racing rainbow background and bold white text that I was very proud of
          at the time.

          Years later, I decided to try learning JavaScript and got hooked. I
          was looking for something new to learn, and stumbled across
          freecodecamp. I started at the beginning with responsive web design,
          HTML and CSS. Enjoying learning, I continued to Data Structures and
          Algorithms with JavaScript, and fell in love with coding.{" "}

          The thing that’s really exciting about learning JavaScript is DOM
          manipulation and all the behind the scenes action that make
          applications jump and dance. There’s a lot to do with data: getting
          it, and then charting, listing, or sending it somewhere. It’s about
          wanting something to work a certain way and learning how to make it
          happen. JavaScript is like a superpower.

          I primarily work with React and JavaScript, but you can see my ToolBox
          below. I'm active in the Twitter Dev Community and enjoy keeping up to
          date with the latest technology. I love to learn and grow.

          My latest project is a JamStack application, using Gatsby. It utilizes
          the leading open source headless CMS: Strapi. It is still a work in
          progress, but you can check out the code to date on{" "}

          I'm always interested in working with positive people on interesting
          projects. I'm currently seeking a full time role where I can be an
          asset to an awesome team.
